# Tecton Fundamentals Tutorial Repo

This feature repository accompanies the [Tecton Fundamentals tutorial](https://docs.tecton.ai/docs/tutorials/tecton-fundamentals/). The tutorial demonstrates how to build feature pipelines for training and serving, using a fictional fraud-detection use case.

This repository contains the skeleton structure for the feature pipelines you will build in tutorial, and is incomplete. As you work through the tutorial, you will add code for the features and other feature-related code.
